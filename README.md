# Homy Node

This repository contains firmware for a room node of the [Homy system](http://quo.vadis.stojkovic.ch/homy-2-0/).

The node is based on [Arduino Pro Mini](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardProMini) 3.3V
and [RFM95W](http://www.hoperf.com/rf_transceiver/lora/RFM95W.html) module.

It is using LoRaWAN connectivity and [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) as a backbone
to connect to [Thingy.IO](http://thingy.io) system as integration platform.

## Description

Homy system and various nodes are part of the home automation project and
described in personal blog [quo.vadis.stojkovic.ch](http://quo.vadis.stojkovic.ch/tag/homy/)
